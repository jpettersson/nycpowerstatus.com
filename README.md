## Project Goals
I want this project to become a valuable resource during emergencies, such as in the aftermath of a Hurricane. I'm also collecting data for future projects where I would like to compare & analyze a multitude of urban data feeds to build some enlightening info graphics and useful services. 

The data collected by this project will soon be available in some suitable format.

## Planned features
