#Is NYC online?
http://nycpowerstatus.com/

Find out if your favorite NYC neighborhood has electricity. Keep track of the Con Edison repairs in the aftermath of hurricane Sandy.
Built using the [coned](https://github.com/ckundo/coned) gem (The latest version is called [Sandy](https://github.com/ckundo/sandy).

## Project Goals
I want this project to become a valuable resource during emergencies, such as in the aftermath of a Hurricane. I'm also collecting data for future projects where I would like to compare & analyze a multitude of urban data feeds to build some enlightening info graphics and useful services. 

The data collected by this project will soon be available in some suitable format.

## Planned features
* IE8+ Support
* Refactor L18n stuff (Sorry it's a bit messy right now, it's been a fast build)
* Switch over to the more stable [Sandy](https://github.com/ckundo/sandy) gem.
* Tweet/Email notifications.

## Feature wish list
* Text Message notifications

I'm looking for a free text provider, please let me know if you have any ideas!
